# Modeling potential impact of RSV interventions on burden and dynamics of hMPV

The code in this repository can be used to reproduce analysis from Howerton *et al.* (submitted 2024). 

## File structure and definitions
* `\data` contains all scripts to run the model and generate the figures
  * `\raw_data` contains raw google mobility data; raw data from Scotland is not provided publicly
  * `\derived_data` includes processed reporting data for RSV and hMPV from Scotland, Korea, and Canada; additional files generated by the analyses have been omitted due to large file sizes 
* `\figures` contains `.pdf` files of all main text and supplemental figures
* `\R` contains all scripts to perform analyses and generate figures
  * `\0_prep_data` scripts to scrape and process raw data
  * `\1_fit_models` STAN files and R scripts to fit SEIRS and SIRS models to Scotland data
  * `\2_run_simulations` scripts to run simulations based on model fits
  * `\3_figures` scripts to generate all main text and supplemental figures
